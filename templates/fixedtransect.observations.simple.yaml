#
# You can also include any extended columns supported by your protocol, use the Name as listed in the protocol definition
# A protocol must already support an extended column for you to be able to use it.
#
# For example, with the fixed transect protocol VCP25H, you would add this field to your observation list of fields:
# 
# VHabitatCdTIMA: <<Habitat Code here>>

# Name each field as "Set.Category": the Set name, plus a dot (.), plus the Category name.
# See the protocol definition for your site condition protocol to get your Sets and Category names. 
#
# For example, with the site condition protocol WEATHER, all 5 fields would be:
#
# Temperature.Temperature: <<Temperature value here>>
# Temperature.TemperatureUnits:  <<Temperature Units here>>
# WindSpeed.WindSpeed: <<Wind Speed value here>>
